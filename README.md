# World_Happiness
The purpose of this project is to determine the differences from 2019 & 2022.

The goal is to find out if there has been a change in the level of happiness around the world between those years.

Determine the changes specifically in the US between those years.

Since the 2 years selected are both pre and post pandemic we want to determine if this may have had an impact on the happiness levels.
